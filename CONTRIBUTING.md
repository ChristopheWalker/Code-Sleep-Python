##Contribution guidelines

First of all, thanks for thinking of contributing to this project. :smile:

Before sending a Pull Request, please make sure that you're assigned the task on a GitHub issue.

- If a relevant issue already exists, discuss on the issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.
- If no relevant issue exists, open a new issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.

Please proceed with a Pull Request only after you're assigned. It'd be sad if your Pull Request (and your hardwork) isn't accepted just because it isn't ideologically compatible.

While making a Pull Request, please take care of the following rules: 

- Make sure the master branch of your forked repo is not any commits ahead than the original master repository.
- Create a new branch from master in the forked repository. Updated your changes in that branch and not in master.
- Include only one work in each pull request. If its a big work, include [WIP] (Work in Progress).
- When including a new enhancement , please update the corresponding requirements.txt by adding a file there.
- Include Proper Documentation in your enhancement.

Any other doubts/questions can be posted as an issue on this repository by using the `doubt` label function.

Thanks again for contributing to this project :heart:
